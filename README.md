## Description

The Express Note Taker App is a simple and efficient web application that allows users to create and delete notes quickly and conveniently. It is built using Express.js, a Node.js web application framework, making it fast and robust. This application is perfect for those who need a straightforward tool to jot down thoughts, ideas, tasks, or any important information with ease.

## What comes next? and other issues...

Express was a very tough concept for me to wrap my head around. I had to adjust my train of thought in regards to defining and creating routes. There was a sharp learning curve with using external clients like Postman, however, once I learned the ropes, I was able to visualize what was happening under the hood of my project.

Moving forward, I'd like to master file structure and further separating code to create a cleaner codespace.
